# android-service-discovery

This repository contains an Android-Library which can perform a Bluetooth SDP Service Discovery 
as well as a Wi-Fi Direct Service Discovery using mDNS-SD. 
Furtheremore there are extensions to automatically connect to searched services / other instances of the app.
The Libraray is located in the `servicecDiscoveryEngine` Module. 

There is also a Demo-Appliccation included which uses the libraray to either just advertise and search nearby 
services or establishes P2P-Connections to them.
